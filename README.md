# React-Movie-App
In React, although there's no functional difference between a `.js` and `.jsx` file, using `.jsx` for components is a good practice. You import React and create a component, ensuring the file and component names match for consistency. By destructuring props, you avoid repetition and can easily pass data. After importing and replacing the component call in `Movies.js`, you map over the movies array to dynamically render multiple movies list. Using `useState` hooks, you manage both the list of movies and the search term. This allows dynamic updates as the search term changes, efficiently rendering movies from the API with proper handling for missing images.
